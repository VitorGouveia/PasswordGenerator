# Sizes

Sizes are used for all kind of spaces, they're meant to be used in paddings, grids, margins, x and y positions and more

They usually follow the same rule as font-sizes and lightness for colors, they start with base value and on top are added with a *step* value

the base is - 6
the step is - 9

Unlike fonts and other "progressive" systems, the size scale can be expanded for as much as we need to
